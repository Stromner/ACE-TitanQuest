# Titan Quest Character Editor

## Purpose
Titan Quest Character Editor (TQCE) is a third party tool that allows you to edit your character as you see fit, which does include cheating.

## Usage
**DO NOT USE ON A FILE THAT IS CURRENTLY IN GAME** - That is a surefire way to corrupt your save file

* Load your save file (java -jar <**jar file**>) and edit away! 
  * [Where do I find my save file?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/475150/discussions/0/276237094312075205/)
* When done make sure to save it back to your system or the changes will be discarded when you exit the program.
